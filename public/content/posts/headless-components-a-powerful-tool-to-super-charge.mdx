Headless components are your secret weapon when it comes to building flexible reusable components. Using this pattern can be overkill many situations. But if you find yourself writing a components library or having to maintain multiple variants of a similar component within your project, then you'll find headless components indispensable.

## What is a headless component?

In essence, a headless component is a component which has no user interface, but _does_ have some underlying logic/functionality.

For the sake of this article, I'll demonstrate using _React_, but this pattern can be utilized by any component based framework.

## Isn't this overly convoluted?

For the majority of your codebase: probably. If the components you build are usually used once off or are used unchanged throughout your application, then headless components _are_ overkill.

That said, if you're supporting a component library or making use of the same components with minor variations throughout your codebase, then that is where headless components shine.

## A (super) trivial use case

In the early days of your codebase, you have the need for a simple manual counter component such as this:

<StackBlitz id="headless-example-1" />
